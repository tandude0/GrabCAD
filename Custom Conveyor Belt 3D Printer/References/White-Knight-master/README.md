White Knight Belt Printer
This repository contains all files necessary to build you own White Knight Belt printer..
Please bear with me as I continue to update files and process assembly videos

I believe all files have been converted to Fusion 360 now.  If you discover a file I've missed please open a new issue and I will get it converted and uploaded.. 

There are people trying to organize group buys for the belt materials..  see link below..
